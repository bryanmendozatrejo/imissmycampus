Citrus Hack 2021: Create Your Zen

#Inspiration#

As the pandemic has forced us to take online classes, many upcoming freshmen and transfer students didn't have a chance to see their campus! I miss my campus solves this by showing you a first-person view of the campus.

#What it does

It shows users the campus they most dearly miss!

#How we built it

By using Google's iFrame Youtube API, we auto-generated videos from popular channels that showed a different part of each campus from around the world. We also used a Spotify embed iframe along with HTML, bootstrap, css and javascript.

#Challenges we ran into

Using iFrame technology felt a bit outdated and was hard to manage to create a full-screen ambiance.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of

Showing youtube videos at fullscreen with no description and only the video.

#What we learned

How to use Youtube'ss iFrame API.

#What's next for imissmycampus

We plan to make this website available to all Universities that have first-person campus tours in which can be utilized for individuals missing their campus or seeing it for the first time.

#Built With

bootstrap, css, html, javascript
